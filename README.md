# Instructions for Windows Mobile Project 2017.
Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP) that will each demonstrate the use of Isolated Storage
and at least one other sensor or service available on the devices. These include:
* Accelerometer or Gyroscope
* GPS (Location Based Services)
* Sound
* Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc)
* Camera
* Multi Touch Gesture Management

## Architecture#

In my project, I use unity Roll-a-ball tutorial and extend it with different functionalityâ€™s, such as:

Touch control and Accelerometer control.

Player ground with maze and collectible objects where designed also jump function where added.

Finished app will be submitted for certification on the Windows Store.

## How to run
Install the app from Windows store.

Use arrows to control the ball and space bar to jump, touch screen also supported on selected laptops.

If the game installed on mobile device, it can be controlled by tilting using Accelerometer sensor.
